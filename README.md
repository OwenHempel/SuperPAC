# SuperPAC
Super Python Analysis for Circuits

## A Python-based Open Source circuit analysis and Simulation tool. Finally.

SuperPAC is a tool written for people who want to simulate and design circuits. With a variety of tools, you can design and simulate to your heart's content.

## Drag and Drop Circuit Builder

As you build your circuit from components, watch your output change!

## Probe Analysis

Want to know what your circuit is doing at a particular component? check it out!

## Simulate Analog and Digital (SAD) Analysis

Once you build your circuits, test the response. Frequency-domain and time-domain packages allow you to take a look at what your circuit will do!
